# cts_check
The code in this repository is intended to assist Bridget Almas and the team at Perseus/Perseids to compare the tags of XML documents with the CTS URNs they create. Perseus XML is occasionally unpredictable and cannot be parse automatically. The supervised parsing of Perseus XML used in this code was developed by Chris Forstall for the Tesserae project at the University at Buffalo (http://www.tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu). See 'LICENSE.md' for more details.
